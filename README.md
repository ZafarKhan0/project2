Blockchain-Based Secure File Sharing
Overview
This project implements a secure file-sharing system using blockchain technology. The system uses Ethereum smart contracts to manage file metadata, access permissions, and ownership. Files are stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized and secure storage.

Features
Upload Files: Store files on IPFS and record file metadata on the Ethereum blockchain.
Grant and Revoke Permissions: Manage file access permissions using Ethereum smart contracts.
Download Files: Access files if you have the necessary permissions.

Architecture
Smart Contract: Manages file metadata and permissions.
Backend: Handles interactions between the frontend, Ethereum blockchain, and IPFS.
Frontend: Provides a user interface for file management and interactions.

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm
Truffle Suite
Ganache (for local Ethereum blockchain)
Metamask (for Ethereum wallet integration)
IPFS account (for using IPFS services)

Setup
1. Smart Contract
*Install Truffle and Compile the Smart Contract:
 npm install -g truffle
 truffle compile
 

*Deploy the Smart Contract:
 truffle migrate --network development
 Ensure you have a local Ethereum node running via Ganache.

2. Backend
 *Navigate to the backend directory:
  cd backend
 
 *Install Dependencies:
  npm install

Configure FileSharingABI.json:
Copy the ABI from the compiled smart contract (build/contracts/FileSharing.json) and save it to backend/FileSharingABI.json.

 *Run the Backend Server:
  npm start
The server will be running on http://localhost:3000.

3. Frontend
 *Navigate to the frontend directory:
  cd frontend

 *Install Dependencies:
  npm install

 *Update ABI and Contract Address:
  Replace placeholder values in frontend/src/FileUpload.js with the actual ABI and contract address.

 *Start the React Development Server:
  npm start
 The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

API Endpoints
Upload File
Endpoint: POST /upload
Request Body:

{
  "filePath": "path/to/your/file"
}

Response:
{
  "fileHash": "QmSomeHashValue"
}
Download File
Endpoint: GET /download/:fileHash
Response: Returns the file content if permission is granted; otherwise, returns a 403 error.

Usage
Upload a File:
Use the frontend interface to select and upload a file. The file will be added to IPFS, and metadata will be recorded on the blockchain.

Grant/Revoke Permissions:
Use the smart contract methods to grant or revoke file access permissions for specific addresses.

Download a File:
Access the file if you have the necessary permissions by using the frontend application.

Deployment
Backend Deployment
-Deploy to a cloud service or server such as AWS EC2 or Heroku.

Frontend Deployment
-Deploy to a static site host like Vercel or Netlify.

Testing
-Smart Contract Tests: Write and execute tests in the test/ directory using Mocha and Chai.
-Backend and Frontend Tests: Ensure functionality using manual testing and integration testing.
